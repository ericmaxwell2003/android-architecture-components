Android Architecture Components + Realm sample
===================================

A Sample using the Architecture Components w/ Realm:

- Realm
- Lifecycle-aware components
- ViewModels
- LiveData
- DAO pattern

It is based off of the [Android Architecture Compnents](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components) sample project provided by Google.  This includes this README which is essentially the Google Readme with the relevant Room/SQLite parts swapped for Realm where it makes sense.

The intent of this fork, is to provide Realm users with knowlege of how to use Realm within the recommened architecture of Google and Architecture Components.  The examples are nearly identical with only the source of the data coming from Realm instead of SQLite.

### Basic Sample

- Shows how to persist data using a Realm database, uses ViewModels,  LiveData, DAOs, Transformations .map, switchMap, and the Dao Pattern with Realm.

This is based off of the AndroidArchitectureComponents [BasicSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/BasicSample).
